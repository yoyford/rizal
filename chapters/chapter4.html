            </div>
            <p>
                <span class="bold">Ateneo</span> was known to be the most prestigious college for boys because of its great teachings. 
                From <span class="bold">1872-1877,</span> under the supervision of the Jesuit priests Rizal studied in Ateneo de Manila. 
                Rizal went to Ateneo Municipal, formerly known as<span class="bold">Escuela Pia</span> . In search for Rizal’s formal knowledge 
                as a high school student, his father wanted to send Rizal to Letran but decided to have him enrolled at 
                the latter instead.
            </p>
            <h3 class="h3_intro">Ateneo De Manila</h3>
            <div class="image">
                <img src="ateneo.jpg" class="rizals"  alt="Republic Act 1425">
            </div>
            <p>
                Rizal took first the entrance examination at the <span class="bold">Colegio de San Juan de Letran on June 10, 1872.</span> His brother, <span class="bold">Paciano,</span> accompanied him when 
                he took the exam. The exams for incoming freshmen in the different colleges for boys were administered or held at the Colegio de San Juan de
                Letran since the Dominicans exer-cised the power of inspection and regula-tion over Ateneo that time. After passing the exam, Rizal was 
                admitted at the Ateneo Municipal.
                Although Rizal qualified in the entrance examination, <span class="bold">Father Magin Ferrand,</span> who was then the College Registrar, refused Rizal’s admission
                in the institution for two reasons: first, Rizal was a late registrant and second, he was very pale, thin and undersized for an <span class="bold"> 11-year old.</span>
                But, with the help of Manuel Burgos he was accepted in the institution. Jose was not able to use Mercado as his surname when he enrolled at Ateneo.
                He was registered as Jose Rizal because his real surname had rung a bell to the ears of the authorities — this was because of Paciano’s relation with 
                one of the leaders of the secularization movement, Father Burgos. At that time, Ateneo was offering a six-year program that gives students the academic 
                title of Bachiller en Artes. This program exposed students to five subjects: <span class="bold">Christian doctrine; Languages of Spanish, Latin, Greek and French; History
                and Geography (World History and Geography and History of Spain and the Philippines; Mathematics and Sciences (geometry, trigonometry, mineralogy, chemistry, 
                physics, botany and zoology); and the Classic disciplines (poetry, rhetoric, and philosophy).</span>
                Ateneo, as a prestigious school, offered the best secondary education for boys that enhances the character of their students through strict religious instruction 
                and discipline. Before the classes start, the students must first hear masses and end with prayers.
                To encourage the spirit of competition among students in academics, with the help of Atenean teachers, the school proposed a program of dividing the class into two
                competing groups (empires): <span class="bold">the Roman Empire composed of boarding students at Ateneo and the Carthaginian Empire composed of non-boarding students.</span> Both groups have 
                ranks and classifications and they competed through question and answers. When banners are raised, it means victory for the group; there is defeat if banners are lowered.
            </p>
            <p>
                Rizal’s first professor was<span class="bold"> Father Jose Bech.</span> At first, Rizal was left behind among his classmates but he knew the severity of his studies, so he organized and
                seriously observed himself a timetable to manage his studies. He excelled as the emperor in his class, a title given to the most intelligent in the class. The 
                method of instruction used at Ateneo was the <span class="bold">  ration studiorum,</span> a system of indoctrination under tight and constant discipline but with reward.
                It applies memorization and understanding of the concepts taught in class. At that time, the Atenean education had one goal: Ad Majorem Dei 
                Gloriam (or For the Greater Glory of God). A student’s life was centered on the chapel, considered as the highest level of extra-curricular 
                activity. Rizal was able to pass his oral examination on <span class="bold">March 14,1877.</span> 
                He finished with the degree, Bachiller en Artes, with the highest academic honors. Looking at Rizal’s scholastic records, it is evident that
                he excelled in his academic studies during the entire time that he was studying at Ateneo. Racial pride, monastic discipline and seclusion of 
                boarding school life were the factors that gave Rizal the motivation to outshine his classmates.
                Note that in doing so, he wanted to prove to his Spanish classmates that a Filipino student can compete and beat them academically. 
                The competition inside the classroom was an opportunity to outdo his classmates in the daily activities designed to test the student’s 
                memory and understanding of their lessons in the different curriculum. For Rizal, being in a boarding school was effective as it gave him more time to focus on his studies.
                Aside from academics, Rizal was also active in extra-curricular activities. He became a member of Marian Congregation and an officer in 
                the religious confraternities at Ateneo. This position is only offered to students who consistently possessed the highest degree of scholarship 
                and leadership. There, he was mentored by <span class="bold">Father Pablo Pastells, S.J.</span> He was also a member of two academic societies:  <span class="bold">Academy of Spanish Literature 
                and the Academy of Natural Sciences,</span> both were considered elite organizations for students who excelled in literature and the sciences.
            </p>
            <h3 class="h3_intro">Sta. Isabel College</h3>
            <div class="image">

            </div>
            <p>
                Rizal took private lessons in <span class="bold">Santa Isabel College</span> to be proficient in Spanish and develop his skills in poetry writing more. 
                But before he took up lessons, he was guided by <span class="bold">Father Francisco Paula de Sanchez</span> in developing his skills in poetry. Through 
                his poetry he was able to finish poems about religion, education, and childhood experiences. It also gave him the opportunity 
                to develop more mature emotions, patriotic sentiments and exquisite sensitivity.
                Rizal did not waste any time to learn new things during his time. On his vacant time,
                Rizal took painting lessons from Agustin Saez and sculpture lessons from Teodoro Romualdo de Jesus to 
                enhance his interest in arts. As a result, he was able to sculpt the image of the Virgin Mary and the 
                Sacred Heart of Jesus. Father Jose Villaclara, S.J. encouraged him to pay attention also to the sciences and philosophy.

            <p>
                After completion of <span class="bold">Bachiller en Artes at Ateneo,</span> Rizal was admitted to higher studies at a university. Doña Teodora was against Rizal’s 
                decision to pursue a higher education because of her fear of what might happen to her son due to the martyrdom of Gomburza. However, Don
                Francisco sent Rizal to UST, the Dominican University of the Philippines.
                At the beginning, Rizal was not sure of what course to take after graduation. His former mentors in Ateneo suggested priesthood or farming, 
                but Rizal considered taking up literature, law or medicine. <span class="bold">Paciano,</span> his brother discouraged him to take law, saying that Rizal will not be 
                able to practice it later on because of the political conditions in the country that time.
                Rizal was<span class="bold">16 years old </span>when he began his freshman year at UST. He enrolled under the Faculty of Philosophy and Letters, Major in Philosophy. 
                This was the course that his father wanted him to pursue, but then it turned out that he took up courses in Cosmology, Metaphysics, Theodicy and History of Philosophy.
                He also took up surveying course at Ateneo. Once again, he excelled in the said course while underage. But because of this, he could not practice the 
                surveyor’s profession yet. Instead, Rizal was presented the title on November 25, 1881 for his excellency. After his first year, Rizal changed his
                course from Philosophy and Letters to Medicine. Rizal believed that he should finish medicine so that he could cure his sick mother who had an eyesight failure.

            <p>
                In February 1880, Rizal wrote a sonnet dedicated to the Philippines that aimed at encouraging Filipino artists 
                to thank the country through their art works. This is the most passionate poem about the Philippines written by Rizal.

            <p>
                Rizal did not continue his studies in the Philippines, instead, he went to Europe to widen his learning and to acquire 
                knowledge about a cure for his mother’s worsening eye condition. He left Calamba on May 1, 1882 and was able to reach 
                Manila in ten hours. He left Manila on  <span class="bold">May 3, 1882,</span> with his brother <span class="bold">Paciano</span> and <span class="bold">Uncle Antonio Rivera’s</span> blessing. He 
                decided to go abroad after completing his fourth year in the medical course. But he did not seek his parents’
                permission because clearly, they will not approve of Rizal’s plan. Bringing with him his disappointments during his days 
                as a student, he left the Philippines for Europe.
                Initially, he was going to finish his medical course in Barcelona, Spain. Then again, he wanted to make a name for 
                himself in the field of journalism, to observe and study the European society and to prepare himself from being freed from the tyrants of Spain
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="bold">At the age of 21,</span> the first piece he made was the essay entitled,  <span class="bold">El Amor Patrio or Love of Country.</span> While writing this, he used the screen name
                Laong Laan. It was published in the Diariong Tagalog in Manila on August 20, 1882.
            </p>
            <h3 class="h3_intro">Madrid</h3>
            <p>
                <span class="bold">On September 1882,</span> Rizal moved to the capital city of Spain to continue his studies. Rizal enrolled at the
                Universidad Central de Madrid on November 3, 1882 he took up Philosophy and Letters in Medicine. While studying 
                in the university, he also enrolled at the Academy of San Carlos taking up painting and sculpture, and languages in French, German and English. He also took up shooting and fencing at the Hall of Sanz and Carbonell. He also showed great interest in taking the examination in Roman law.
                Rizal passed the medical examination which he took from June 5 to 26. He was given the degree of Licentiate in Medicine
                for this and continued his doctorate degree in medicine. However, he was not able to accomplish the diploma because he 
                failed to present the thesis required for graduation. He was allowed to practice medicine but cannot teach medicine. 
                Rizal was saddened by this decision and thought that the education system in Madrid had no difference with that in Manila. 
                He then finished his course in Philosophy and Letters and gained the degree Licenciado en Filosofia y Letras. During this time,
                Rizal was halfway done with his novel, the Noli Me Tangere.
            </p>
            <h3 class="h3_intro">CIRCULO HISPANO FILIPINO</h3>
            <div class="image">

            </div>
            <p>
                <span class="bold">Circulo Hispano Filipino</span> was a social organization meant to create reforms for the Philippines. The members were mostly Filipino elderlies, 
                who were exiles of 1872. It was led by Juan Atayde, a retired army officer and a Philippine-born Spaniard. They conducted informal programs,
                which included poetry reading and debates. Even with a busy schedule, Rizal took the time to join his fellow Filipinos in Madrid. The group 
                knew that Rizal is a good writer — he was actually requested to comment or write a few verses to the review published by the group. Rizal 
                was able to do the poem entitled Mi Piden Versos (They Ask Me for Verses).
                Rizal, while in Madrid, sent a letter to Don Francisco about joining the Circulo Hispano. But 
                later on, he told him that the society was disbanded because of:<br><span class="bold"> 1) the differences among its members who were young student expatriates and retired colonials,</span>and<br> 
                <span class="bold"> 2)due to their age difference.</span><br> It was difficult for Rizal during his stay in Madrid. There were delays in his monthly allowance coming from the Philippines, 
                considering the financial status of Rizal’s family caused by crop failures brought by drought and locusts, and the increase in rentals of the Dominican 
                hacienda lands in his hometown. Truth be told, there were times when Rizal attended his classes on an empty stomach.
                Influenced by Miguel Morayta, a history professor at the Universidad de Madrid, Rizal became a member of freemasonry with “Dimasalang” 
                as its masonic name. It is an organization outlawed by the Catholic Church because its beliefs are contrary to the doctrines of the church. 
                It is said that the mason’s view of life is that, knowledge should be achieved by the light of reason and universal brotherhood of men. He 
                became a Master Mason in Lodge Solidaridad on November 15,1890. Hence, Rizal was immediately removed from the Catholic church.
                Rizal’s love interest in Madrid was Consuelo, Don Pabolo’s daughter. Because of her good traits and beautiful smile he got attracted 
                and fell for her but he held back his feelings for Consuelo knowing that he was engaged with Leonor Rivera in the Philippines. Aside 
                from this, Rizal did not want to ruin his friendship with Eduardo de Lete, who is the latter’s love interest. Before leaving Madrid in 1883, 
                Rizal composed a poem that expressed his admiration to Consuelo, entitled A La Senorita C.O. y R.
                On June 25, 1884, in honor of Juan Luna and Felix Hidalgo Rizal made a speech, the Brindis which gave him 
                praises from the public
                audience because for the first time, they heard a Filipino delivering a speech fluently in the Castillan 
                language. He stated that Luna and Hidalgo were the pride of Filipino people. Luna was awarded the top prize for 
                his painting Spolarium while Hidalgo got the second place for his painting Virgines Christianas Expuestas al Populacho 
                (Christian Virgins Exposed to the Population).
                Both Filipino painters joined the National Exposition of Fine Arts. In his speech, Rizal said that intelligence knows no 
                race and the prizes they got were results of both Philippines and Spain. He also hoped that someday, Spain will accept the 
                changes that the Filipinos have to offer. The speech was published in the newspaper, El Liberal.

            <h3 class="h3_intro">Paris</h3>
            <p>
                Rizal arrived in Paris on<span class="bold">November 1885.</span>  At that time, he was 24 years old and a full-pledged surgeon. 
                He decided to migrate to Paris to specialize in Ophthalmology, but prior to doing so, he went to visit 
                Maximo Viola, a friend from San Miguel, Bulacan. Rizal also worked as an assistant to Dr. Louis de Weckert’s
                eye clinic for four months. During his stay, Rizal knew how to conduct the operation of the eye, its ailments, 
                and the different techniques of eye operation. He spent his past time with his fellow Filipinos in the city, 
                something that contributed much to learning how to speak French fluently. His friends were Felix Hidalgo, 
                Juan Luna and Pardo de Tavera. For the duration of his stay with Juan Luna, Rizal became a model and posed 
                for two historical paintings of Luna: The Blood Compact (as Sikatuna) and Death of Cleopatra (as a Priest). 
                It was also in Paris that he finished some part of his Noli.

            <h3 class="h3_intro">Germany</h3>
            <p>
                Due to high cost of living, Rizal left Paris for Germany on <span class="bold">February 1886. </span>He arrived at an old university town in Heidelberg. 
                He worked as an assistant of Dr. Otto Becker at the University Eye Hospital. It is where Rizal mastered the techniques of diagnosing eye 
                ailments, which he learned from Dr. Louis de Wecker. But before transferring to the university, Rizal resided in a German boarding house
                where he became friends with a number of German law students.
                He became a member of the Chess Players’ Club of Heidelberg. 
                He was known among the students not because he was good at chess but because he also joined them in their drinking sessions. 
                While in Heidelberg, he used to write letters to his sis-ters Maria and Trinidad in the Philippines, telling them good things 
                about Germany, the good traits of the German students including the women. The letter was to show her sisters that they can imitate 
                the virtues of German women. There, he wrote a poem entitled, A Las Flores de Heidelberg (To the Flowers of Heidelberg) to express his 
                homesickness for his loved ones.
            </p>
            <h3 class="h3_intro">Calamba</h3>
            <p>
                Rizal lived five years of his life abroad and away from his loved ones. He left Rome and rode the train going to Marseilles, France 
                on <span class="bold">July 3,1887.</span>  He then boarded the Djemnah, the vessel that ferried him to Saigon, and from Saigon, he transferred to the steamer 
                Haiphong in Vietnam and reached Manila on August 5,1887. He stayed in Manila for three days and tried to visit and call Isabelo de los Reyes 
                twice but unfortunately, he was unable to reach him.
                Later on, he visited Ateneo wherein the Jesuits attempted to get Rizal back to his old faith. Rizal was able to talked to Padre Faura, 
                the priest who showed him the Sacred Heart of Jesus that he carved during his student days. Then, Padre Faura told Rizal all the wrong 
                points that he said in his novel, Noili Me Tangere. But for Rizal, everything he wrote was the truth.
                Upon Rizal’s arrival in Calamba on <span class="bold">August 8, 1887,</span> there were rumors spreading that Rizal was a German spy, a mason and many more. Because 
                of these, Rizal received death threats each day and his family was worried about the possible consequences of such. So Paciano accompanied 
                him whenever he goes out— even his father, Don Francisco, had hesitations on allowing Rizal to go out of their house.
                Nevertheless, Rizal kept himself busy while in Calamba. He established a medical clinic and his first patient was his mother. He cured the 
                sick and soon he was known to be an eye specialist and surgeon. Rizal successfully removed the cataracts on his mother’s eyes. In the town, 
                Rizal was called Doctor Uliman, because he was mistaken for a German. On August 30, 1887, Rizal left Calamba and went to Manila for he was 
                invited to see Governor-General Emilio Terrero as regards his Noli.

                Rizal arrived in Hong Kong on <span class="bold">February 8,1888.</span> His fellow Filipinos namely <span class="bold">Jose Maria Basa, Balbino 
                Mauricio and Manuel Yriarte, </span>who were all exiled in 1872, met Rizal. In Hong Kong, he was able to study 
                the Chinese language, Chinese drama and theater, Chinese cultures and Chinese values. Rizal even became friends with
                some Spaniards that were based in Hong Kong.
                He met <span class="bold">Barranda, </span>Terrero’s secretary, together with other Spaniards and went to visit Macao, 
                a Portuguese colony near Hong Kong. Rizal and his friends visited the botanical garden, theatre, 
                casino, cathedral and churches, pagodas and bazaars. They lived in the house of Juan Lecaroz and on
                <span class="bold">February 20, 1888,</span> he went back to Hong Kong. Two days after, he left for Japan on Board the SS

            <p>
                Rizal arrived in <span class="bold">Yokohama, Japan </span>and stayed at Tokyo Hotel on February 28, 1888f or a few days. He was then invited by 
                Juan Perez Caballero to live at the Spanish Legation for a month.<span class="bold"> On March 7,1887,</span> he left the hotel and lived at the 
                Spanish legation. During his stay in Japan, he studied the Japanese language or Nippongo, Japanese culture, theatres, 
                martial arts and visited Japanese provinces. Rizal appreciated the cleanliness, politeness, and industry of the Japanese.
                Rizal then met O-Sei-San and their romance began when he lived at the Spanish legation. They became friends and later 
                on developed to become lovers.<span class="bold"> O-Sei-San or Seiko Usui</span> and Rizal fell in love for each other. Because of this, Rizal 
                thought of staying in Japan for good. Nonetheless, Rizal had duties to fulfill for his country. So he decided to leave 
                Japan and said his goodbyes to O-Sei-San.

                Aboard a steamer on <span class="bold">April 28,1888,</span> the entire boat was quarantined when it stopped in San 
                Francisco because accordingly, the ship came from a country where cholera was epidemic. 
                Rizal knew that this was not the fact — he found out that the ship was halted for the Chinese and Japanese laborers who accepted cheap labor, replacing the American laborers.
                On  <span class="bold">May 4, 1888,</span> after a week of the quarantine, some passengers were allowed to disembark, 
                except for the Japanese and Chinese passengers who were quarantined for a longer period. Rizal went 
                to different cities in America like Reno, Utah, Colorado, Nebraska, Chicago, Albany, and New York City. 
                He was very much impressed with all the cities for its natural beauty, the hardworking Americans, 
                the material progress and the high standard of living, and the opportunities offered for poor immigrants for a better life.
                The negative impressions include the lack of racial equality and the presence of racial prejudice 
                against other nations. The Americans value valued money more than human life and fairness and justice were only offered to white people.

            <h3 class="h3_intro">TRIP IN LONDON</h3>
            <p>
                After Rizal’s trip to the United States of America, he left New York City on May 16, 1888 and arrived in 
                Liverpool, England on<span class="bold"> May 24</span> of the same year. He stayed for a day at Adelphi Hotel and left for London 
                the following day. He was welcomed by Dr. Antonio Ma. Regidor on May 25, 1888 and stayed as a guest in 
                their home. Dr. Regidor was an exile of 1872 and a practicing lawyer in London.
                Rizal had reasons why he chose to live in London. First, he wanted to enhance his knowledge on the English 
                language; he sought to have further study on Antonio Morga’s Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas; to do research on 
                the Philippine history; and to continue to write for La Solidaridad in defense of his people against the Spanish tyranny.
            </p>
            <h3 class="h3_intro">IN BRUSSELS, BELGIUM</h3>
            <p>
                On <span class="bold">January 28,1890, </span>Rizal left Paris for Brussels, Belgium. He was accompanied by Jose Alberto when he moved to Brussels. 
                When Jose Alberto left the country, an engineering student, Jose Alejandro stayed with Rizal at the boarding house 
                owned by Suzanne and Marie Jacoby. Aside from the cost of living in Paris, which was too much, Rizal cannot focus on 
                writing his second novel El Filibusterismo because of the social life in Paris that interfered with his writings. While 
                doing the chapters of the novel, he continued to write articles for La Solidaridad and they were:
                <span class="bold">1. “ A La Defensa” (To la Defensa)</span> on April 30, 1889 as his answer to an Anti-Filipino writing of Patricio de la Escorura; <br>
                <span class="bold">2. “La Verdad Para Todos” (The Truth For All)</span> on May 31, 1889 as his reply against the Spanish accusations that the Filipino officials were ignorant and immoral;<br>
                <span class="bold">3. “Vicente Barrantes’ Teatro Tagalo”</span> on June 15, 1889;<br>
                <span class="bold">4. Barrantes’ ignorance on the theatrical art of the Tagalog;</span><br>
                <span class="bold">5. “Una Profanacion” (A Profanation)</span> on July 31, 1889 as his attack against the friars for ignoring and not allowing Christian burial for his brother-in-law, Mariano Herbosa;<br>
                <span class="bold">6. “Crueldad” (Cruelty)</span> on July 31, 1889 defending Blumentritt from mocking and insulting attacks of his rivals;<br>
                <span class="bold">7. “Verdades Nuevas” (New Truths)</span> on August 15, 1889, that because of the letter written by Vicente Belloc Sanchez, saying that if reforms were granted, it will start in the destruction of the peaceful ruling of the friars in the Philippines;<br>
                <span class="bold">8. “Diferencias” (Differences)</span> on September 15, 1889 in response of the attacks of the article, saying mean and bad comments to the Filipinos who were then protesting for reforms from the Spanish government;<br>
                <span class="bold">9. “Inconsequencias” (Inconsequences)</span> on November 30, 1889 to defend Antonio Luna against the attacks of Pablo Mir Deas’s article in El Pueblo Soberano, a newspaper in Barcelona;<br>
                <span class="bold">10.“LLanto y Risas” (Tears and Laughters)</span> on November 30, 1889 as Rizal’s way of saving the Filipinos from the Spaniards racial prejudice;<br>
                <span class="bold">11.“Ingratitudes” (Ingratitudes)</span> on January 15, 1890 in response to Governor-General Weyler’s words, that people of Calamba should not be fooled by empty promises of their ungrateful sons.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                On the other hand, Rizal received bad news coming from home that his family and relatives were 
                forced to leave and go to different places because the Calamba land problem had worsened, that 
                the Dominican management raised the rents for the land. This was the reason why the tenants, including Rizal’s father, refused to pay the rent, which resulted for the filing of a case by the Dominicans to strip the ownership of Calamba land from the Rizal family.
                The illegal eviction of his family angered him and made him depressed. Rizal planned to go home 
                to the Philippines because he could not bear the pain about what happened to his family. Rizal 
                then wrote a poem entitled<span class="bold"> “A Mi Musa” (To My Muse)</span> to address his disappointments on the land 
                problems of Calamba. This poem was published in La Solidaridad with <span class="bold">Laong Laan</span> as Rizal’s pen 
                name on December 15,1890.
                Rizal failed to defend the case against the Dominicans and justice was not received for his 
                family and the tenants of Calamba. While in Madrid, Rizal attended a gathering of Filipinos where
                he had a fight with Antonio Luna and dared Wenceslao Retana to a duel. Retana, was a Spanish 
                scholar and Rizal’s rival in writing.
            </p>
            <h3 class="h3_intro">LIFE IN HONG KONG</h3>
            <p>
                Rizal left Madrid and went to Hong Kong after he published the El Fili in Europe. He did not like the 
                political situation between him and del Pilar, and the other Filipinos in Spain. It was during this time 
                that Rizal heard that his friend, Jose Ma. Panganiban (his pen name was Jomapa), bid his farewell to the 
                world. As saddened as he was, he recognized Jomapa’s talent, intelligence, and industry through a eulogy, considering him as a lost for the country.
                Due to his unpleasant experiences in Madrid, Rizal planned on leaving the political life in Europe to 
                focus on his mission instead. <span class="bold">On November 20,1891, </span>he arrived in Hong Kong. He then decided to practice 
                medicine, through his association with<span class="bold">Dr. Lorenzo P. Marquez,</span>  so he applied for a license and the license 
                and was eventually granted. His family went to Hong Kong and he supported them in the city.
