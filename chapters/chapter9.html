            </div>
            <p>
                Rizal’s “Filipinas Dentro De Cien Años” (translated as “The Philippines within One Hundred Years” or “The Philippines A Century Hence”) is 
                an essay meant to forecast the future of the country within a hundred years. This essay, published in La Solidaridad of Madrid, reflected Rizal’s 
                sentiments about the glorious past of the Philippines, the deterioration of the Philippine economy, and exposed the foundations of the native Filipinos’ 
                sufferings under the cruel Spanish rule. More importantly, Rizal, in the essay, warned Spain as regards the catastrophic end of its domination – a reminder 
                that it was time that Spain realizes that the circumstances that contributed to the French Revolution could have a powerful effect for her on the Philippine islands.
                Part of the purpose in writing the essay was to promote a sense of nationalism among the Filipinos – to awaken their minds and hearts so they would fight for their rights.

            <h3 class="h3_intro"> CAUSES OF MISERIES</h3>
            <h3 class="young">1. Spain’s implementation of her military laws</h3>
            <p>
                Because of such policies, the Philippine population decreased significantly. Poverty became more widespread, and f
                armlands were left to wither. The family as a unit of society was neglected, and overall, every aspect of the life 
                of the Filipino was retarded.
            </p>
            <h3 class="young">2. Deterioration and disappearance of Filipino indigenous culture</h3>
            <p>
                When Spain came with the sword and the cross, it began the gradual destruction of the native Philippine culture. Because of 
                this, the Filipinos started losing confidence in their past and their heritage, became doubtful of their present lifestyle, and 
                eventually lost hope in the future and the preservation of their race. The natives began forgetting who they were – their valued 
                beliefs, religion, songs, poetry, and other forms of customs and traditions.
            </p>
            <h3 class="young">3. Passivity and submissiveness to the Spanish colonizers</h3>
            <p>
                One of the most powerful forces that influenced a culture of silence among the natives were the Spanish friars. 
                Because of the use of force and intimidation, unfairly using God’s name, the Filipinos learned to submit themselves 
                to the will of the foreigners.
            </p>
            <h3 class="h3_intro"> Rizal's Forecast</h3>
            <p>
                One of the most powerful forces that influenced a culture of silence among the natives were the Spanish friars. 
                Because of the use of force and intimidation, unfairly using God’s name, the Filipinos learned to submit themselves 
                to the will of the foreigners.
            </p>
            <p>
                What will become of the Philippines within a century? Will they continue to be a Spanish Colony? Spain was able to colonize the Philippines for 
                300 years because the Filipinos remained faithful during this time, giving up their liberty and independence, sometimes stunned by the attractive 
                promises or by the friendship offered by the noble and generous people of Spain.
                Initially, the Filipinos see them as protectors but sooner, they realize that they are exploiters and executers. So if this state of affair continues, 
                what will become of the Philippines within a century? One, the people will start to awaken and if the government of Spain does not change its acts, 
                a revolution will occur. But what exactly is it that the Filipino people like? 1) A Filipino representative in the Spanish Cortes and freedom of expression to 
                cry out against all the abuses; and 2) To practice their human rights. If these happen, the Philippines will remain a colony of Spain, but with more laws 
                and greater liberty. Similarly, the Filipinos will declare themselves ’independent’.
                Note that Rizal only wanted liberty from Spaniards and not total separation. In his essay, Rizal urges to put freedom in our land through peaceful negotiations 
                with the Spanish Government in Spain.
                Rizal was confident as he envisioned the awakening of the hearts and opening of the minds of the Filipino people regarding their plight. He ‘prophesied’ that the 
                Philippines will be successful in its revolution against Spain, winning their independence sooner or later. Though lacking in weapons and combat skills, the natives waged war 
                against the colonizers and in 1898, the Americans wrestled with Spain to win the Philippines.
                Years after Rizal’s death, the Philippines attained its long-awaited freedom — a completion of what he had written in the essay, <span class="bold"> does not record in its archives any 
                lasting domination by one people over another of different races, of diverse usages and customs, of opposite and divergent ideas. One of the two had to yield and succumb.”</span>
                Indeed, the essay, The Philippines a Century Hence is as relevant today as it was when it was written over a century ago. Alongside Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo, Rizal 
                shares why we must focus on strengthening the most important backbone of the country – our values, mindsets, and all the beliefs that had shaped our sense of national identity.
                Additionally, the essay serves as a reminder that we, Filipinos, are historically persevering and strong-minded. The lessons learned from those years of colonization were that 
                all those efforts to keep people uneducated and impoverished, had failed. Nationalism eventually thrived and many of the predictions of Rizal came true. The country became 
                independent after three centuries of abusive Spanish rule and five decades under the Americans.

            <h3 class="h3_intro">SOBRE LA INDOLENCIA DE LOS FILIPINOS
                (The Indolence of the Filipinos)</h3>
            <p>
                This is said to be the longest essay written by Rizal, which was published in five installments in the La Solidaridad, from July 15 to September 15, 1890. The essay 
                was described as a defense against the Spaniards who charged that the Filipinos are inherently lazy or indolent. The Indolence of the Filipinos is said to be a study 
                of the causes why the people did not, as was said, work hard during the Spanish regime. Rizal pointed out that long before the coming of the Spaniards, the Filipinos 
                were industrious and hardworking. The Spanish reign brought about a decline in economic activities because of the following causes:<br>
                <span class="bold"> First,</span> the establishment of the Galleon Trade cut-off all previous associations of the Philippines with other countries in Asia and the Middle East. 
                As a result, business was only conducted with Spain through Mexico. Because of this, the small businesses and handicraft industries that flourished 
                during the pre-Spanish period gradually disappeared.<br>
                <span class="bold"> Second,</span> Spain also extinguished the natives’ love of work because of the implementation of forced labor. Because of the wars between Spain and other 
                countries in Europe as well as the Muslims in Mindanao, the Filipinos were compelled to work in shipyards, roads, and other public works, abandoning agriculture, industry, and commerce.<br>
                <span class="bold"> Third,</span>Spain did not protect the people against foreign invaders and pirates. With no arms to defend themselves, the natives were killed, their houses 
                burned, and their lands destroyed. As a result of this, the Filipinos were forced to become nomads, lost interest in cultivating their lands or in rebuilding 
                the industries that were shut down, and simply became submissive to the mercy of God.<br>
                <span class="bold"> Fourth,</span> there was a crooked system of education, if it was to be considered an education. What was being taught in the schools were repetitive prayers 
                and other things that could not be used by the students to lead the country to progress. There were no courses in Agriculture, Industry, etc., which were 
                badly needed by the Philippines during those times.<br>
                <span class="bold"> Fifth,</span> the Spanish rulers were a bad example to despise manual labor. The officials reported to work at noon and left early, all the while doing nothing 
                in line with their duties. The women were seen constantly followed by servants who dressed them and fanned them – personal things which they ought to have done for themselves.<br>
                <span class="bold"> Sixth,</span> gambling was established and widely propagated during those times. Almost everyday there were cockfights, and during feast days, the government 
                officials and friars were the first to engage in all sorts of bets and gambles.<br>
                <span class="bold"> Seventh, </span>there was a crooked system of religion. The friars taught the naïve Filipinos that it was easier for a poor man to enter heaven, and so they 
                preferred not to work and remain poor so that they could easily enter heaven after they died.<br>
                <span class="bold">Lastly,</span> the taxes were extremely high, so much so that a huge portion of what they earned went to the government or to 
                the friars. When the object of their labor was removed and they were exploited, they were reduced to inaction.
                Rizal admitted that the Filipinos did not work so hard because they were wise enough to adjust themselves to the warm, 
                tropical climate. “An hour’s work under that burning sun, in the midst of pernicious influences springing from nature in 
                activity, is equal to a day’s labor in a temperate climate.” He explained, “violent work is not a good thing in tropical 
                countries as it would be parallel to death, destruction, annihilation.” It can clearly be deduced from the writing that the 
                cause of the indolence attributed to our race is Spain: When the Filipinos wanted to study and learn, there were no schools, 
                and if there were any, they lacked sufficient resources and did not present more useful knowledge; when the Filipinos wanted to 
                establish their businesses, there was not enough capital nor protection from the government; when the Filipinos tried to cultivate 
                their lands and establish various industries, they were made to pay enormous taxes and were exploited by the foreign rulers.

            <h3 class="h3_intro">LETTER TO THE YOUNG WOMEN OF MALOLOS</h3>
            <p>
                Jose Rizal’s legacy to Filipino women is embodied in his famous essay entitled, “To the Young Women of Malolos,” where he addresses all 
                kinds of women – mothers, wives, the unmarried, etc. and expresses everything that he wishes them to keep in mind.
                On December 12, 1888, a group of 20 women of Malolos petitioned Governor-General Weyler for permission to open a night school so 
                that they may study Spanish under Teodor Sandiko. Fr. Felipe Garcia, a Spanish parish priest in Malolos objected. But the young women 
                courageously sustained their agitation for the establishment of the school. They then presented a petition to Governor Weyler 
                asking that they should be allowed to open a night school (Capino et al, 1977).
                In the end, their request was granted on the condition that Señorita Guadalupe Reyes should be their 
                teacher. Praising these young women for their bravery, Marcelo H. del Pilar requested Rizal to write a 
                letter commending them for their extraordinary courage.
                Originally written in Tagalog, Rizal composed this letter on February 22, 1889 when he was in London, 
                in response to the request of del Pilar. We know for a fact that in the past, young women were uneducated 
                because of the principle that they would soon be wives and their primary career is to take care of the home and 
                their children. In this letter, Rizal yearns that women should be granted the same opportunities given to men in terms of education.
                The salient points contained in this letter are as follows:<br>
                <span class="bold">1. The rejection of the spiritual authority of the friars – not all of the priests in the country that time embodied the true spirit of Christ 
                and His Church. Most of them were corrupted by worldly desires and used worldly methods to effect change and force discipline among the people.<br></span>
                <span class="bold">2. The defense of private judgment<br></span>
                <span class="bold">3. Qualities Filipino mothers need to possess – as evidenced by this portion of his letter, Rizal is greatly concerned of the welfare of the Filipino children and the homes they grow up in.<br></span>
                <span class="bold">4. Duties and responsibilities of Filipino mothers to their children<br></span>
                <span class="bold">5. Duties and responsibilities of a wife to her husband - Rizal states in this portion of his letter how Filipino women ought to be as wives, in order to preserve the identity of the race.<br></span>
                <span class="bold">6. Counsel to young women on their choice of a lifetime partner<br></span>
            </p>
            <h3 class="h3_intro">QUALITIES MOTHERS HAVE TO POSSESS</h3>
            <p>
                Rizal enumerates the qualities Filipino mothers have to possess:<br>
                <span class="bold">1. Be a noble wife - that women must be decent and dignified, submissive, tender and loving to their respective husband.<br></span>
                <span class="bold">2. Rear her children in the service of the state – here Rizal gives reference to the women of Sparta who embody this quality. 
                    Mothers should teach their children to love God, country and fellowmen.<br></span>
                <span class="bold">3. Set standards of behavior for men around her - three things that a wife must instill in the mind of her husband: 
                    activity and industry; noble behavior; and worthy sentiments. In as much as the wife is the partner of her husband’s heart and 
                    misfortune, Rizal stressed on the following advices to a married woman: aid her husband, share his perils, refrain from causing 
                    him worry; and sweeten his moments of affliction.<br></span>
            </p>
            <h3 class="h3_intro">RIZAL’S ADVICE TO UNMARRIED MEN AND WOMEN</h3>
            <p>
                Jose Rizal points out to unmarried women that they should not be easily taken by appearances and looks, because these can be very deceiving. Instead, they should take heed of men’s firmness of character and lofty ideas. Rizal further adds that there are three things that a young woman must look for a man she intends to be her husband:<br>
                <span class="bold">1. A noble and honored name<br></span>
                <span class="bold">2. A manly heart<br></span>
                <span class="bold">3. A high spirit incapable of being satisfied with engendering slaves.<br></span>
            </p>
            <h3 class="h3_intro">Summary</h3>
            <p>
                In summary, Rizal’s letter “To the Young Women of Malolos,” centers around five major points (Zaide &Zaide, 1999):<br>
                <span class="bold">1. Filipino mothers should teach their children love of God, country and fellowmen.<br></span>
                <span class="bold">2. Filipino mothers should be glad and honored, like Spartan mothers, to offer their sons in defense of their country.<br></span>
                <span class="bold">4. Filipino women should educate themselves aside from retaining their good racial values.<br></span>
                <span class="bold">5. Faith is not merely reciting prayers and wearing religious pictures. It is living the real Christian way with good morals and manners.<br></span>
