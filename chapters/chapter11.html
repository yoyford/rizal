            <h2 class="h3_intro">  JOSE RIZAL AND PHILIPPINE NATIONALISM: National Symbol</h2>
            <p>
                According to the <span class="bold">Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA),</span>  official national symbols of the Philippines represent the 
                country’s traditions and ideals and convey the principles of Philippine sovereignty and national solidarity.
                Some of these symbols are stated in the Flag and Heraldic Code of the Philippines, which is also known as <span class="bold">Republic Act 8491. </span>
                The national language of the Philippines is Filipino as stated in the Constitution of the Philippines. Aside from those stated 
                symbols in the Constitution and in Republic Act 8491, there are only five official national symbols of the Philippines enacted 
                through law, namely <span class="bold">1) sampaguita as national flower,</span> <span class="bold">2) narra as national tree,</span><span class="bold"> 3) the Philippine eagle as national bird, </span>
                <span class="bold">4) Philippine pearl as national gem</span> and > <span class="bold">5) arnis as national sport.</span>
                There are symbols such as the carabao (national animal), mango (national fruit) and anahaw (national leaf) that are widely known 
                as national symbols but have no laws recognizing them as official national symbols. Even Jose Rizal, who is widely considered as a
                national hero, has not been declared officially as a national hero in any existing Philippine law according to historical experts. 
                Although in 2003, Benigno Aquino, Jr. was officially declared by the President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo as a national hero by an executive order. 
                On the other hand, a National Artist of the Philippines is a rank or a title given to a Filipino citizen in recognition to the recipient's 
                contributions to Philippine arts and letters and they are not considered as a national symbol that represents traditions and ideals.
                On February 17, 2014, Bohol First District Representative Rene Relampagos filed a bill at the Philippine House of Representatives that 
                seeks to declare or re-declare and to recognize a number of national symbols. The proposed bill, House Bill 3926 or the "Philippine National Symbols Act of 2014", 
                aims also to encourage nationalism and unity; to guarantee respect, preservation and promotion of national symbols; and to correct the "unofficial" status of the 
                symbols. Among the proposed national symbols listed in the measure are Jose Rizal as the only historical Filipino to be recognized as national hero, adobo as national 
                food and jeepney as national vehicle. It also includes the previously mentioned national symbols.
                During the Commonwealth Era in 1934, it was Governor-General Frank Murphy who declared sampaguita and narra as national flower and national tree, respectively, through 
                Proclamation No. 652. Philippine President Fidel Ramos proclaimed the Philippine eagle as the national bird in 1995 through Proclamation No. 615. Ramos also declared the 
                South Sea Pearl or Philippine Pearl as the national gem in 1996 through Proclamation No. 905. In 2009, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo declared arnis as the national 
                sport and martial art through Republic Act 9850.
                In February 2013, the Philippine Senate passed a bill declaring waling-waling (Vanda sanderiana) as the national flower alongside sampaguita. A similar bill in the House 
                of Representatives had already been passed in 2012. Normally, the bill would become law after being signed by the President however, it was vetoed by President Benigno 
                Aquino III. The veto has left the waling-waling as an unofficial national symbol.

            <h3 class="h3_intro">  MAKING A NATIONAL SYMBOL OFFICIAL</h3>
            <p>
                A Philippine national symbol will be considered official once it is declared through a law or a proclamation. National 
                symbols such as the cariñosa, carabao, bangus (milkfish), and anahaw (footstool palm) that are circulating through various 
                sources have no official status and have not established by law. According to Nestor Castro, a Filipino cultural anthropologist, 
                most of these unofficial symbols were passed on as tradition in schools every start of the school year when students were asked to 
                buy posters containing the supposed national symbols. While official national symbols are declared through law, Castro and National 
                Historical Commission of the Philippines (NHCP) Section Chief Teodoro Atienza considered that the public must be consulted first before 
                declaration of national symbol.
            </p>
            <h3 class="h3_intro"> FILIPINOS AS NATIONAL SYMBOL</h3>
            <p>
                According to the NHCP Section Chief Teodoro Atienza, and Filipino historian Ambeth Ocampo, there is no Filipino historical 
                figure officially declared national hero through law or executive order, although there were laws and proclamations honoring 
                Filipino heroes. In the Rizal Law principally sponsored by Claro M. Recto and enacted in 1956, Jose Rizal is mentioned as a 
                national hero in the "whereas" clause of the law. Although, "whereas" clauses function as a preamble or introduction and it is 
                not part of the provisions. On November 15, 1995, the Technical Committee of the National Heroes Committee, created through 
                Executive Order No. 5 by former President Fidel Ramos, recommended nine Filipino historical figures to be National Heroes: 
                Jose Rizal, Andres Bonifacio, Emilio Aguinaldo, Apolinario Mabini, Marcelo H. del Pilar, Sultan Dipatuan Kudarat, Juan Luna, 
                Melchora Aquino, and Gabriela Silang. No action has been taken for these recommended National Heroes until it was revisited 
                in one of the proceedings of the 14th Congress in 2009.
                On 3 August 2009, shortly after the death of former President Corazon Aquino, widow of Benigno Aquino, Jr., legislative measures
                have been filed calling for her official recognition as a national hero. Congresswoman Liwayway Vinzons-Chato filed a house resolution 
                declaring Corazon Aquino a national hero. Although, a week after she filed the resolution, she realized that there is no Filipino historical 
                figure declared through law. On August 10, 2009, she cited on her privilege speech in Congress the nine Filipino heroes recommended by National 
                Heroes Committee in 1995. She then urge the Congress to sign the resolutions declaring the nine Filipinos recommended by the National Heroes 
                Committee plus Benigno Aquino, Jr. and Corazon Aquino as national heroes. Congressman Salvador Escudero interpellated Vinzons-Chato's speech 
                and stated that heroes are made in the hearts and minds of people and not through legislation. After the interpellation, it was moved by House 
                of Representatives to refer the privilege speech of Vinzons-Chato to the Committee of Basic Education and Culture. Up to now, these resolutions 
                have not been acted upon.
                As mentioned earlier, in a measure filed by Congressman Relampagos from Bohol in February 2014, he sought to declare Jose Rizal as the sole 
                Filipino national hero. According to the bill, he was a nationalist and well known for his Philippine reforms advocacy during the Spanish colonial era.
            </p>
            <h3 class="h3_intro"> RIZAL AS A NATIONAL SYMBOL</h3>
            <p>
                It was shown in the previous lesson how Rizal was recognized as our national hero. Granting that he belongs to the unofficial national symbols, it cannot be de-nied 
                that Rizal’s name and memory have long been representing the principles of sovereignty and national solidarity, symbolizing our country.<br>
                Even in the international arena, Rizal’s name elicits the name of our country. In places where he had been and where his books [and the books about him] are found 
                in foreign libraries, the name Philippines is necessarily indicated. Indeed, Ri-zal is unquestionably the greatest hero and martyr of our nation. Borrowing the words of De Ocampo:<br>
                <span class="bold2" >"The day of his birth and the day of his execution are fittingly commemorated by all classes of our people throughout the length and 
                breadth of this country and even by Filipinos and their friends abroad. His name is a byword in every Filipino home while his picture 
                adorns the postage stamp and paper money of widest circulation. No other Filipino hero can surpass Rizal in the number of towns, barrios, 
                and streets named after him; in the number of educational institutions, societies, and trade names that bear his name; in the number of persons, 
                both Filipinos and foreigners, who were named "Rizal" or "Rizalina" because of their parents’ admiration for the Great Malayan; and in the number 
                of laws, Executive Orders and Proclamations of the Chief Executive, and bulletins, memoranda, and circulars of both the bureaus of public and private 
                schools. Who is the Filipino writer and thinker whose teachings and noble thoughts have been frequently invoked and quoted by authors and public speakers 
                on almost all occasions? None but Rizal. And why is this so? Because as biographer Rafael Palma said, "The doctrines of Rizal are not for one epoch but for 
                all epochs. They are as valid today as they were yesterday. It cannot be said that because the political ideals of Rizal have been achieved, because of the change 
                in the institutions, the wisdom of his counsels or the value of his doctrines have ceased to be opportune. They have not."</span>
            </p>
            <h3 class="h3_intro"> VALUES DERIVED FROM RIZAL’S LIFE</h3>
            <p>
                From the various representations of Rizal as a national symbol, one may learn significant ideals and principles 
                that may be of good use in everyday life. By studying Rizal’s life and works, the following values may be captured 
                (as adopted from Mañebog et. Al, 2018):<br>
            </p>
            <h3 class="young">1. Nationalism and Patriotism</h3>
            <p>
                Nationalism involves the desire to attain freedom and political independence, especially by a country under a foreign power. Jose Rizal’s life, 
                works and writings, especially his novels, radiate this value.
            </p>
            <h3 class="young">2. Patriotism</h3>
            <p>
                Patriotism denotes proud devotion and loyalty to one’s nation. Rizal’s visions and proposals on how the 
                people of our country could be on the road to progress are commendable. The aim, of course, is so that 
                the Filipinos could enjoy the fullness of nationhood, especially politically, culturally, and economically, 
                under the mantle of national solidarity.
            </p>
            <h3 class="young">3. Faith in God</h3>
            <p>
                When Rizal was studying in Madrid, Spain, he assured his mother, through his letter, of his faith in God. When his sister Olympia dided of childbirth in 1887, 
                Rizal pronounced, <span class="bold2">console myself saying that it was the will of God and what He does must be the best.”</span>
            </p>
            <h3 class="young">4. Love of Fellowmen</h3>
            <p>
                Rizal advocated thinking well of our fellowmen. His life exemplified the principle that love of neighbor entails involvement 
                in his or her behalf. Rizal’s thought on love for our fellowmen is biblical and timeless.
            </p>
            <h3 class="young">5. Love of Parents</h3>
            <p>
                Rizal’s love for his parents is great and very admirable. He studied medicine and ophthalmology 
                just to cure his mother’s failing eyesight. Rizal also adored his father. In 1881, he made a clay 
                bust of his father. About six years later, he carved a life-size wood sculpture of Don Francisco as 
                an expression of his love for him. In his novels, Noli and El Fili, the character of Ibarra has also 
                shown his love for his father.
            </p>
            <h3 class="young">7. Purity and idealism</h3>
            <p>
                Rizal was a person guided not only by practical considerations but also by ideals. Extraordinary also was his insistence on purity of thoughts.
            </p>
            <h3 class="young">8. Noble Thought and Conduct</h3>
            <p>
                Rizal’s works and writings promoted good conduct, clean conscience, and upright thinking. 
                In his writings, for instance, he advised mothers to awaken the mind of the children and 
                prepare them for every good and desirable thought and deed.
            </p>
            <h3 class="young">9. Charity</h3>
            <p>
                Rizal seemed to feel happy when he could give joy to somebody. All his sacri-fices for his country were charitable acts for his fellowmen.
            </p>
            <h3 class="young">10. Dedication to Duty</h3>
            <p>
                Dedication to one’s duty was another splendid virtue of Rizal. He virtually dedicated his whole 
                life in securing freedom for his country and happiness for his people, a commitment historically 
                unequaled in the history of his country.
            </p>
            <h3 class="young">11. Moral Courage</h3>
            <p>
                Rizal’s courage in working for the betterment of his country, despite all odds, is a virtue that is so 
                essential even today. His moral courage to do the best for his people is worth imitating by our present leaders.
            </p>
            <h3 class="young">12. Willpower</h3>
            <p>
                Willpower is the ability to control or restrain oneself. Although the Spanish colonizers instilled in Rizal’s 
                generation inferiority complex and the idea that locals were better governed by the Spaniards, Rizal worked on 
                the opposite idea that his people could be great and deserved freedom.
            </p>
            <h3 class="young">13. Integrity</h3>
            <p>
                Integrity refers to the quality of being honest and having strong moral principles. In many 
                aspects, Rizal is a model of moral uprightness and honesty. These virtues he held were the result of his constant love and search for the truth.
            </p>
            <h3 class="young">14. Sincerity</h3>
            <p>
                Patriotism denotes proud devotion and loyalty to one’s nation. Rizal’s visions and proposals on how the 
                people of our country could be on the road to progress are commendable. The aim, of course, is so that 
                the Filipinos could enjoy the fullness of nationhood, especially politically, culturally, and economically, 
                under the mantle of national solidarity.
            </p>
            <h3 class="young">15. Self-Denial</h3>
            <p>

            <p>
                The concept of officially recognizing heroes began in the Philippines in 1900 when the Philippine Commission (Pardo de Tavera, Legarda, Luzurriaga (Filipino members) 
                and headed by William Howard Taft) approved Act No. 137 combining the districts of Morong and Manila to be named as “Province of Rizal,” in honor of the most illustrious 
                Filipino. From that time on, heroes were celebrated here and there, hearing their names in many speeches, declaring holidays, naming streets, constructing monuments, 
                and many more, in their honor.<br>
                It was until one day that the need to evaluate the situation was proposed, realizing that there were so many names that were acknowledged as heroes. During Ferdinand 
                Marcos’ presidency, he tasked the National Heroes Commission to come up with the criteria for national hero. On March 28, 1993, thru the President’s Executive Order No. 75 
                under the former President Fidel V. Ramos, the National Heroes Committee (NHC) was created. They were commissioned to study, evaluate and recommend historical figures to 
                be declared as national heroes. The Committee composed of worthy members , with a series of discussions came up with the new criteria. The criteria is composed of 10 standards and they are as follows:<br>
