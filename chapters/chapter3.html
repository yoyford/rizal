                Whenever people of a country truly love<br>
                The language, which by heaven they were taught to use<br>
                That country also surely liberty pursue<br>
                As does the bird which soars to freer space above.<br>
                For language is the final judge and referee<br>
                Upon the people in the land where it holds sway;<br>
                In truth our human race resembles this way<br>
                The other living beings born in liberty.<br>
                Whoever knows not how to love his native tongue<br>
                Is worse than any beast or evil smelling fish.<br>
                To make our language richer ought to be our wish<br>
                The same as any mother loves to feed her young.<br>
                Tagalog and the Latin language are the same<br>
                And English and Castilian and the angel’s tongue;<br>
                And God, whose watchful care o’er all is flung,<br>
                Has given us His blessing in the speech we claim.<br>
                Our mother tongue, like all the highest that we know<br>
                Had alphabet and letters of its very own;<br>
                But these were lost – by furious waves were overthrown<br>
                Like bancas in the stormy sea, long years ago.<br>
