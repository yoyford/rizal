            <p><span class="bold">Republic Act No. 1425,</span> commonly known as the Rizal Law, was enacted on June 12, 1956, and was chiefly sponsored and 
                authored by <span class="bold">Senators Jose P. Laurel and Claro M. Recto.</span> This legislation obliges all public and private schools,
                colleges, and universities in the Philippines to include the life, works, and writings of national hero Jose Rizal in 
                their course curricula. This specifically includes studying Rizal's novels Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo.

                <h3>Republic Act 1425</h3>
            </div>
            <p>Prior to the enactment of the <span class="bold">Rizal Law (Republic Act No. 1425), Senate Bill No. 438 </span>was submitted to the Senate Committee 
                    on Education on April 3, 1956. This bill, which later became the Rizal Law, proposed to include courses on the life, works, and 
                    writings of Jose Rizal, specifically his novels<span class="bold">Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo, </span> in the curricula of all public and private schools, 
                    colleges, and universities. 
                    The bill also included provisions for the printing and distribution of these works, among other related purposes.

                <h3>Jose P. Laurel</h3>
            </div>
            <p><span class="bold">On April 17, 1956, Senate Bill No. 438,</span> which aimed to include the life, works, and writings of Jose Rizal in the curriculum of all schools, was presented to the Senate by Senator Jose P. Laurel. Senator Laurel emphasized that the primary purpose of the bill was to promote the ideas and ideals of Jose Rizal, particularly through his novels Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo. He advocated for all Filipinos to read these works to understand their national identity, strengths, and weaknesses, fostering self-reliance, self-respect, and freedom.

                A similar bill,<span class="bold">House Bill No. 5561, was filed by Congressman Jacobo Z. Gonzales </span> in the House of Representatives. Both bills faced opposition based on questions of constitutionality and religiosity. A substitute proposal was then put forward, broadening the scope to include all of Rizal's works, rather than focusing solely on Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo. 
                
                Senator Laurel also insisted on the importance of reading the original and unexpurgated editions of Rizal's novels. Both Senate Bill No. 438 and House Bill No. 5561 were unanimously approved on the second reading in both the Senate and the House of Representatives on <span class="bold">May 12 and 14, 1956,</span>  respectively. 
                <span class="bold">On June 12, 1956, President Ramon Magsaysay</span> signed the bill into law, establishing <span class="bold">Republic Act 1425, or the Rizal Law.</span>
            </p>
            <p>Think about this again: Why study the life and works of Rizal? It is apparent that during Rizal’s time, 
                the Filipino identity is already diminishing—this was the rationale behind the enactment of the Rizal Law, which seeks to accomplish the following objectives:<br></span>
                <span class="bold"> 1) To rededicate the lives of the youth to the ideals of freedom and nationalism, for which our heroes lived and died;<br></span>
                <span class="bold">2) To play tribute to our national hero for devoting his life and works for shaping the Filipino character;<br></span>
                <span class="bold">3) To gain an inspiring source of patriotism thru the study of Rizal’s life, works and writings.<br></span>
                The late Senator Jose P. Laurel, who sponsored the said law emphasized the need to know and imbibe the great ideals and principles for which Rizal died. After all, Rizal was the founder of Filipino nationality and the architect of the Filipino nation. It is by reading and studying Rizal’s life, teachings and writings that the young generation of the Philippines will be able to gain incorruptible confidence, direction, courage and determination to move forward in our people’s journey towards an abundant life.
                The teaching of Rizal Course in higher education institutions in our country today is anchored on the patriotic policy statements 
                of Rizal Law and the patriotic goals set by the then Board on National Education (Capino et. Al, 1997). These goals are as follows:<br>
                <span class="bold">1) To recognize the relevance of Rizal’s ideals, thoughts, teaching, and life values to present conditions in the community;<br></span>
                <span class="bold">2) To apply Rizal’s ideas in the solution of day-to-day situations and problems in contemporary life;<br></span>
                <span class="bold">3) To develop an understanding and appreciation of the qualities, behavior and character of Rizal; and<br></span>
                <span class="bold">4) To foster the development of moral character, personal discipline, citizenship and vocational efficiency among the Filipino youth.<br></span>
                Thus, the importance of the study of Rizal’s life, works and writings is to instill in ourselves the idea and ideals of Jose Rizal, and to develop a deeper awareness and understanding of its relevance so that in the long run, we may be able to apply them in our daily lives and become an active participant in nation-building.
